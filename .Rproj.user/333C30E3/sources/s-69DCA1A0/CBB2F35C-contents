SUMM QUESTIONS (Section 1):
  Is the need for Emergency Shelters trending up/down?
  1.0: Emergency Shelters Trends
    When observing the need for emergency shelters we do this by two measures:
  1.0a: 211 Callers - Emergency Shelters
    This will help determine new users or returning users of emergency shelters which can help represent demand.
  1.0b: Emergency Shelter Load
    This will help determine daily emergency shelter load which can help represent demand.

STAT QUESTIONS(Section 2):
  2.1: Is number of callers influenced by the borough the caller is from?
  2.2: Does demographic of emergency shelter user influence overcapacity rate?
  2.3: Is emergency shelter usage influenced by season, time of month, or time of week?

## Introduction 

SECTION 0 : Background information (Skippable)

0.0 : What is an emergency shelter?
An emergency shelter is defined as a facility thatâ€™s used to house residences temporarily for emergency situations. Common inhabitants of shelters include both individuals and families. The reason of use may vary, but common rationale for using the shelters usually involve fleeing a dangerous situation such as: natural/ man-made disaster, domestic/sexual violence and abuse. In emergency situations such as extreme cold or rain, some of these shelters operate as warming centres for the homeless should they have the capacity to do so. The facilities provide various accommodations for residents including beds, meals, showers, counselling, and referral to: legal, health, and employment services.


0.1 : Who are the demographic of an emergency shelter?
The demographic of the emergency shelters includes a wide range of people. These include both male/female adults/youth, and families of varying sizes. The shelters are usual portioned off by sector to accommodate the various residence. They have spaces that are for men, women, youth, co-ed, families, and those with more specific/ sensitive needs such as victims of abuse.


## Data 

TODO: Rewrite for full report
(*Description of data used to answer the questions*)

Currently Used Data
  Source: 211 Caller Data
  Usage: Geographical, Caller Reason, Caller demographic, and Caller Gender data  for emergency shelters
  Variables and Observations
    Level3Name - Category variable that helps us slice 211 caller data for emergency shelter
    Level4Name - Category variable to help distingusih different reasons for calling in terms of emergency shelters
    PostalArea - Postal Codes of Toronto
    DateOfCall - Date of call
    NeedWasMet - Boolean specifiying if the needs of the caller was met
    Demographics of Inquirer - Age Category - Determines if caller is Youth, Adult, Order Adult, or Unknown
    Demographics of Gender - Age Category - Determines if caller is Male, Female, or Unknown

  Bias
    The PostalArea has a non-responce bias. That is there is a large amount of calls that contain NULL in PostalArea


  Source: Daily Shelter Occupancy (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/daily-shelter-occupancy/)
  Usage: Geographical Data on the location of shelters as well as occupancy to calculate demographics and usage
  Variables and Observations
    OCCUPANCY_DATE - Date of shelter operation
    SHELTER_NAME - Name of shelter
    SHELTER_ADDRESS - Address of shelter
    SHELTER_POSTAL_CODE - postal code of shelter
    SECTOR - Categorisation variable for different parts of any paticular shelter
    OCCUPANCY - The count of occupants in any paticular shelter sector
    CAPACITY- The count of availale spaces in any particular shelter.
   
  Bias
    There is possible bias towards families since they wouldn't be counted as a group, so a family group of 4 is not 1 entry but 4 in terms of the OCCUPANCY variable. Though it would still be hard to mangle the variable into a way that would could a single family group since the number of members in a family can range from 2 to more.


  Source: Toronto Postal Codes (https://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/postalcode/fpc.jsf)
  Usage: Converting Postcodes to City of Toronto Boroughs and Neighborhoods
  Variables and Observations
    Postcode - Postal Codes of Toronto
    Borough - Boroughs of Toronto
    Neighborhoods - Neighborhoods of Toronto
    
  Bias
    N/A

## Analysis 
TODO: Rewrite for full report


SECTION 1: Data Summaries 
1.0 : Emergency Shelter Trends
Method
  For this topic we can look at both our data sets to see if we can find trends. We'll use our 211 caller data and see if the frequency of calls increases over time using different grouping views. Our grouping views will consist of daily, weekly, and monthly. The reason why we'll exclude yearly is that the data abstraction will be too much to obtain any information from.
  
  We'll split the analysis into two sections, 1.0a and 1.0b for 211 Caller Data and Emegency Shelter Data respectively. Doing this we can get two different measures on increasing emegency shelter usage. In 1.0a we'll be observing if the trend for 211 calls increases or decreases over the years. In 1.0b we'll observe two variables: overall load and overload rate. Overall load will consist of the sum of all occupants over capacity to calculate how full a shelter is. Overload rate will consist of overall mean at which the shelters are at or over capacity.
    
Analysis

1.0a 211 Callers
Here we will take the callerData and split the date into year, month, week and day.
Afterwards we'll group by increasingly abstracted groups to get the count of calls per month, week and day.
Finally we'll graph it and draw conclusions.
```{r}
callerData %>%
  select(DateOfCall) %>%
  mutate(Year = year(DateOfCall), Month = month(DateOfCall), Week = week(DateOfCall), Day = day(DateOfCall)) %>%
  group_by(Year, Month, Week, Day) %>%
  mutate(callsByDay = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Year, Month, Week) %>%
  mutate(callsByWeek = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(Year, Month) %>%
  mutate(callsByMonth = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=DateOfCall)) + geom_line(aes(y=callsByDay, colour = "Daily")) + geom_line(aes(y=callsByWeek, colour = "Weekly")) + geom_line(aes(y=callsByMonth, colour="Monthly")) + labs(y="Calls", colour="Caller Groupings")
```
  
1.0b Emergency Shelter Load
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_RATE = mean(OVERCAPACITY)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=OCCUPANCY_DATE)) + geom_line(aes(y=LOAD, colour='Load Rate')) + geom_line(aes(y=OC_RATE, colour="Overcapacity Rate")) + labs(y="Measures", colour="Rates")
```

Conclusion  
  1.0a : Bias we have to look out for is the subset of repeat callers. This is because we do not know if we are encapsulating entirely all new callers, or repeat callers in any given day. Looking at the graph there is no discernable trend as it seems to vary month by month. We can see a slight increase around early 2019 but it quickly moves back down.

  1.0b : Bias we have to consider for this is that since services offered by shelters isn't all the same some shelters may have a overload rate of 1 if their only sector they provide for is overloaded. Similarly a shelter would never reach 1 or above load unless every sector they provide for is overloaded or occupancy exceeds capacity. The trend for the graph however is once again not discernable. There is a large decrease in december 2019 but it quickly returns to normal.
  
  We can conclude that there is not any paticular upward or downard trend.
  

1.1 Is every caller able to reach a nearby emergency shelter?
  Method
    Here we'll take the caller data and do a check to see if it matches a postal code of any shelter, if it is then we can consider that the user is able to reach an emergency shelter (regardless of if it is full/overcapacity or not)
    
  Analysis
    Here we'll simply pull all FSA codes of shelters in Toronto and filter all FSA codes of callers not in the shelters FSA. If we find any calls that exist in FSA that aren't in a shelters FSA we can summarise those.
```{r}
callerData %>%
  filter(PostalArea != "NULL") %>%
  filter(!(PostalArea %in% (shelterData %>%
                            mutate(SHELTER_POSTAL_CODE = str_sub(SHELTER_POSTAL_CODE, 1, 3)) %>%
                            select(SHELTER_POSTAL_CODE) %>%
                            distinct() %>%
                            pull()))) %>%
  group_by(PostalArea) %>%
  summarise(calls = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(calls))

```
  Conclusion
    There are two biases to consider here. The first being that our caller locaiton data is only from a vocal minority and matches FSAs.
    The second is that a user may be able to reach a shelter yet just not at the exact FSA of said shelter.
    The conclusion we can draw from this is that East York Region could use more emergency shelter coverage
  
  
1.2 Which regions are emergency shelters in high demand?
  Method
    Here we can do a inner join on postal code, this will yield us the caller's borough. After that we do a simple summarise on the data to yield the total number of calls over the years for emergency shelters
    
  Analysis
    We'll transform the data by filtering so we only have calls with location data. After we can join our callerData with postalBorough to get our borough data from the calls. Finally we can do a simple summation to get the number of calls by borough.
```{r}
callerData %>%
  filter(PostalArea != 'NULL') %>%
  inner_join(postalBorough, by=c('PostalArea' = 'Postcode')) %>%
  group_by(Borough) %>%
  summarise(Calls = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(Calls))
```

  Conclusion
    We consider that the dataset contains non-responce bias but should be a fine sample. In regards to the data is should be pretty clear that a lot of callers are from the DT, Scaborough,North York and Etobicoke boroughs.


SECTION 2
  2.1: Does borough influence number of calls in a day?
    Method
      We can use an indepetendence test to see if the numbere of calls in a day is influenced by the borough. Specifically this will tell us on any given day if borough influences how many calls are recived.

    Analysis
      Here we simply do a join to get boroughs then after summarising we do an independence test on the number of calls in a day and borough to see if they're related.
      In this case our H0  : The borough and number of calls are not related
                      Halt : The borough and number of calls are related
      We'll work with the standard 5% p-value
```{r}
callerData %>%
  filter(PostalArea != 'NULL') %>%
  inner_join(postalBorough, by=c('PostalArea' = 'Postcode')) %>%
  mutate(Borough = factor(Borough)) %>%
  group_by(DateOfCall, Borough) %>%
  summarise(Calls = n()) %>%
  independence_test(Calls ~ Borough, data = ., distribution = "approximate")
```  
   TBD perhaps resample to see if test it true
   
   Conclusion
    Given that our p-value resulted in 0.0004 we can conclude that borough does influence our calls in a day. Likewise we can say that 1.2 is not a fluke and some boroughs recieve more calls/day than others.
   
  
  
  2.2: Does sector of emergency shelter user influence overcapacity rate?
   Method
      This one is a little more complex than 2.1. Here we need to get the overcapacity rate of emergency shelters, aftewards we'll need to do an independence test to see if sectors and overcapacity rate are related. This specifically will point out if some sectors are often overcapacity, moreso than others.  

  Analysis
    We can use shelter data like previously to get the overcapacity rate. The difference is now we'll use that in tandem with the factor SECTOr and an independence test.
    In this case our H0  : All sectors are equally likely to have overcapaity issues
                    Halt : Some sectors are more often overcapacity than others
    We'll work with the standard 5% p-value
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0), ORGANIZATION_NAME = factor(ORGANIZATION_NAME), SECTOR = factor(SECTOR)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_RATE = mean(OVERCAPACITY)) %>%
  independence_test(SECTOR ~ OC_RATE, data = ., distribution = "approximate")
```  
  Conclusion
    Given that our p-value resulted in 0.0004 we can conclude that emergency shelter sector does influence overcapaity rate. Succinctly, some sectors are more often overcapaity than other sectors.
    
  2.3: Is emergency shelter usage seasonal (monthly) ?
  Method
      This one is a little more complex than 2.1. Here we need to get the overcapacity rate of emergency shelters, aftewards we'll need to do an independence test to see if sectors and overcapacity rate are related. This specifically will point out if some sectors are often overcapacity, moreso than others.  

  Analysis
    We can use shelter data like previously to get the overcapacity rate. The difference is now we'll use that in tandem with the factor SECTOr and an independence test.
    In this case our H0  : All sectors are equally likely to have overcapaity issues
                    Halt : Some sectors are more often overcapacity than others
    We'll work with the standard 5% p-value
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0), MONTH = month(OCCUPANCY_DATE)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, MONTH) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY)) %>%
  independence_test(MONTH ~ LOAD, data = ., distribution = "approximate")
```
  Conclusion
    Given that our p-value resulted in 0.0004 we can conclude that emergency shelter sector does influence overcapaity rate. Succinctly, some sectors are more often overcapaity than other sectors.


SECTION 3:

  3.1: Can we classify shelters as regularly overloaded based on their load
  Method
    Here we will use threshold classification to find a classifer that will tell us if a shelter is overloaded base solely on its load. This is a useful metric because it'll let us have a good metric for if a shelter should expand or not. I.e. if our classifer is the best at < 0.7 load we can recommend any shelter with an overall load <= 0.7 that they should expand their services.
    
  Analysis
    Here we'll graph our shelter data to see what a good inital classifer would be. From the graph we can determine that 0.895 is a pretty good divide between overcapacity and high load.
  
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OVERCAPACITY_TODAY = ifelse(sum(OVERCAPACITY) >= 1, TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = LOAD, fill = OVERCAPACITY_TODAY )) + geom_histogram(position = "dodge", bins=30) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0.895)
```


To confirm this we can make a crosstab with our data comparing our guess and the real state of the emergency shelters 
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_REAL = factor(ifelse(sum(OVERCAPACITY) >= 1, TRUE, FALSE))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate( OC_GUESS = factor(ifelse( LOAD > 0.895, TRUE, FALSE))) %>% 
  mutate( OC_GUESS = fct_relevel(OC_GUESS, "TRUE"),
          OC_REAL = fct_relevel(OC_REAL, "TRUE") ) %>% 
  xtabs( ~ OC_GUESS + OC_REAL, data = .) %>% addmargins()
```

Plotting an ROC curve shows that out our model is moderately accurate able to reach about a 75% precision/75% recall
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_REAL = factor(ifelse(sum(OVERCAPACITY) >= 1, TRUE, FALSE))) ->
  shelterDataCapacity

ROC_out = roc(OC_REAL ~ LOAD,  data=shelterDataCapacity)
ggroc(ROC_out)
auc(OC_REAL ~ LOAD,  data=shelterDataCapacity)
```
  Conclusion
    THe classifer that is used can reliably predict and classify if a shelter is overcapacity
  
  3.2: Relationship between load and overcapaity
Method
  Here we can have a pretty simple straightforward proccess.
  First we'll create our linear model using a library.
  Next we'll graph our model to see how well the linear model fits.
  Finally we use the linear model to assist in helping us visualise any trends in the data.


Analysis
  Here we create our linear model of load by overcapacity rate
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0), ORGANIZATION_NAME = factor(ORGANIZATION_NAME), SECTOR = factor(SECTOR)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_RATE = mean(OVERCAPACITY)) %>%
  lm(LOAD ~ OC_RATE, data=.) %>%
  summary() %>%
  tidy()
```

Plotting our regression line shows a pretty accurate representation of the data 
```{r}
shelterData %>%
  select(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME, SECTOR, OCCUPANCY, CAPACITY) %>%
  filter(CAPACITY >= 0) %>% #Remove rows with NA
  mutate(OVERCAPACITY = ifelse(OCCUPANCY >= CAPACITY, 1, 0), ORGANIZATION_NAME = factor(ORGANIZATION_NAME), SECTOR = factor(SECTOR)) %>%
  group_by(OCCUPANCY_DATE, ORGANIZATION_NAME) %>%
  summarise(LOAD = sum(OCCUPANCY)/sum(CAPACITY), OC_RATE = mean(OVERCAPACITY)) %>%
  filter(LOAD > 0.6) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = LOAD, y = OC_RATE)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Conclusion
  Looking at the graph with the linear model its pretty clear that there is a trend that as load increases our probability of being overcapacity also increases.
